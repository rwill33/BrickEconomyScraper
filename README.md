# About

Brick Economy Scraper is a script built to pull the latest data on retiring lego sets from brickeconomy.com.
This app is built with Python3 and uses the beautiful soup library to retrieve and parse the HTML pages, and write the data to a csv file. It also implements multiprocessing to speed up the rate at which the application can pull the data.

# Setup

1. Run pip install

2. Run python3 main.py
